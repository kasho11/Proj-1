%Project: Project 1: Intro to Matlab
%Date: 10/9/2014
%Class: CS1300 Computational Linear Algebra
%Professor: Dr. Terry Boult

%Purpose: This project was a basic introduction to matlab.  The assignment
%was broken up into three parts, each building off of the functionality of
%the previous.  The first part simply reads a file containing points of a 
%figure and plots the figure centered around the origin.  The second part
%takes the figure and shears it, and possibly transforms it.  The final 
%part reads a list of new origin points and new axis and transforms the 
%figure to fit the new target box.
